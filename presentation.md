# Capstone Presentation
The capstone presentation highlights your application as the culmination of your work at Ada.
It should be __no more than 5 minutes__ in length and should have the following components:

Ubot

For my capstone, I wanted to try and build a chat-bot that would allow you to chat with "yourself". So, I began with how I might create one to talk like me.  I assumed someone had already attempted something like this and I began my research. Sure enough someone had. I studied Hendrik J. Weideman's project in which he trained his computer on his own facebook chats, https://hjweide.githubio/char-rnn, but in the end I went with an existing code repository by Laura Gelston utilizing an implementation of Char-rnn, a LTSM recurrent neural network, in this case built on TensorFlow and packaged as an Python/Flask API. My fancy plan was to "understand" everything about her repo, of course, feed it a google data archive of my sent gmail messages, train it, and presto, magically have a genius chat-bot. 

I broke this perfectly feasable plan down into 3 parts:

Front-end: Ideally this would be a real-time chat app, utilizing socketing instead of ajax requests both directions
Server: My actual thought - "This part can remain a mystery until I get to it."
Back-end: Deep Learning model set up as an API

I spent a great deal of time reading and researching in preparatin and upon actaully initiating the project, a few things were clear:
I would have to build some king 
  What I learned from creating this project:
  - Example: "I learned that the best way for me to learn is to try a tutorial out and break everything as I go!"
- What are 1-2 major features of the application, demoed from the eyes of a user?
- Optional: Exciting or interesting technologies you used
- Optional: Future enhancements

Prior to demoing, you should have the following:
- Each group should coordinate to use two computers for the demos in your group (first 3 or 4 people, and last 3 or 4 people). It would be best to choose one with an HDMI port
- Dry run at least 2x prior to the demo, in front of someone else
- Know the sequence of events that you will execute to show the features you want to demo
- Prepare slides for any non-app talking points
